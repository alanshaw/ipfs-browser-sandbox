> An EXPERIMENTAL p2p browser built on IPFS

### ⚠️ Reference Use Only! ⚠️

**The IPFS Browser Sandbox is not a product intended to ship to end users.**  

It is a Technology Preview for how [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)/[IPLD](https://ipld.io/) resources could be represented in web browser components.

It is here for demos, experimentation and fun times.

It's also **not secure** and may be partly or entirely broken. Use at your own risk.

## Install

There are currently no binaries available for download. You must build the project from source. Good news though, it's easy!

```console
git clone https://github.com/alanshaw/ipfs-browser-sandbox.git
cd ipfs-browser-sandbox
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage

It's a browser, you know what to do...but wait! It also allows you to browse the IPFS-iverse. Paste an IPFS hash into the URL bar and the content will appear on the page. Magic!

### Developers

There's a watch script that'll watch all the JS files and re-build them when you make changes:

```console
npm run watch
```
